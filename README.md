# Crowder_FinalProject

Final project for Data Wrangling in R

# Summary of this Repository

This repo is made to hold the data that will be used for the 
final project of Data Wrangling in R (Ellen Bledsoe's class at 
University of Arizona). This will be where the final is created 
and stored.

## Data Structure of this Repository

The expected sub-directory structure will be based on the
example shown in class. It will have a scripts folder to hold 
the assignment, a data_raw folder to hold the raw/original 
data, a data_clean folder to hold the modified data, 
a documents folder to keep the information, and an outputs 
folder to hold the visuals and other images created from this
project.
